## 📝 Frequently Asked Questions

***Can I play online with addons?***
> You can play with most mods on community servers, but joining official matchmaking will get you kicked (and result in competitive cooldown).

***Will I get VAC Banned for using addons?***
> No, as long as you don't use cheats like sv_pure bypassers and skin changers.

***I found a bug. Where do I report it?***
> You can open an issue **in addon repository**. 

***I need more help with modding.***
> You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6AbkcN8) and ask all questions there.
