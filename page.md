# Intro

Despite being very active, CSGO modding community isn't very known to public. The purpose of this guide is to explain basics of modding.

You will NOT get VAC-banned for using mods. You can play online, EXCEPT official matchmaking. Any official Valve server will kick you from the game (more information at the end of the guide).

# How to Install

[MIGI](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GKYQvl5NOUKKYmqiJjWXmUDKkRLJ_FFw) is the best and most efficient way to install mods. It was developed by Zool, the guy behind Classic Offensive.

Once downloaded, navigate to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive folder (on Steam, right click on CS:GO, go to "Properties", "Local Files", "Browse Local Files"). Paste migi.exe here and run as administrator.

All .vpk extension files must start with "m_" in their name, all folders - with "p_". In this case I will have to rename "Nebula Crystal M9.vpk" to "m_Nebula Crystal M9.vpk" and "GongFu_csgo" to "p_GongFu_csgo"

**Make sure that all file folders (materials, models, sounds, scripts and etc) are placed DIRECTLY in the root of p_folder. If there are any folders in between (for example: "p_gongfu/csgo/materials") it will not install!**

This is how your addons should look after everything is setup:

<br>

Now that everything is ready, make sure that all addons are displayed in addons folder. Click "generate MIGI" to apply changes. Now you can launch CSGO. Be sure to do that through MIGI. **Steam must be running, otherwise game won't launch!**

<br>

If you want to play CSGO without mods, just launch csgo through Steam, normally.

To uninstall any mods just delete them from addons folder, or remove "p_" or "m_" from the name/

# FAQ

**Can you play online with this?**
> You can play on almost every community server, in offline lobbies with friends or with bots. Official matchmaking (competitive, casual, danger zone, etc) will kick you from the game.

<br>

**Will I get VAC Banned for this?**
> No you will not get banned for this as long as you don't use injectors and sv_pure bypassers. MIGI does not inject anything it is just a tool to automate modding routine.

<br>

**Pure Server: Client file doesn't match server**
> This means mods are not supported on this server. Try joining another one.

<br>

**FATAL ERROR: Failed to connect with local Steam Client process!**
> This means the Steam isn't running, or cannot connect to CSGO. Try rebooting Steam.

<br>

**The game crashes when I start MIGI**
> If MIGI CSGO crashes but unmodded one works, you might need to check the mods you installed. Sometimes removing resources and scripts folders work.

<br>

**All textures are black**
> Some mods require shaders to be set on high or above.
